## About the project

HCMUT stands for Ho Chi Minh city University of Technology. You can see more information about this school [here](http://www.aao.hcmut.edu.vn/). That is the university I am studying. At the time a do this project, I just a second-year student. So traditionally, I have to go to intern in the industry in next year. Since this subject is too hard for registering, my university also help student by strengthening bond between university and industry. So if the company recruit the internship position, they will give the offer to my university. After checking which one is suitable and ensure the benefits of student. 

Because there are still have some cases that internship but do not have any 
training the engineer skill, soft skill, team work, do project with mentor.  
As expected, 

And about this project, I will crawl all the internship offers of all company that my school admitted.

All the information about the website that I will crawl, you can see it here: [Link here](https://internship.cse.hcmut.edu.vn/internship).
